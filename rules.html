                <h3>
                Horizon RP is an 18+ server.  You must be 18 years of age or older to play.  There is absolutely no exception to this rule.
                <br>
                <br>
                No exceptions or accommodations shall be made for individuals who do not wish to adhere to our server rules. Server administrators shall maintain uniform expectations and shall hold those who fail to meet them accountable.
                
                Ignorance of any clearly written and published rule is not an excuse, and all violations will be treated as if they are intentional.
                Server administrators and server ownership reserve the right to take corrective action toward actions/behavior(s) which they deem to be disruptive, unacceptable or clearly detract from the fellow players’ experience, even if the actions/behavior(s) do not directly violate a rule or policy listed on this page.
                
                </h3>

                2) You must have a working microphone with no background noise. Voice changers are acceptable, but they must be understandable and not overly loud, too quiet, or extremely high or low pitched.
                <br>
                <br>
                3) Be respectful to other players and do not be toxic.  The use of ANY racial, homophobic, or derogatory slurs is prohibited.  NO warning will be issued for breaking the rule.
                <br>
                <br>
                4) The use of glitches, exploits, or hacks is prohibited.
                <br>
                <br>
                5) If you find a glitch or exploit, please notify the admin team through a bug report on Discord.  Failure to notify the staff team will be considered power gaming and will result in a permanent ban.
                <br>
                <br>
                6) Horizon RP is a serious RP server.  If you have never participated in a serious RP server, please reach out to staff with any questions you may have.  It is REQUIRED for all players to read and understand the rules.  If you don’t understand a rule, please ask a staff member.  All ban appeals stating “I didn’t know that was a rule” will not be considered for reinstatement.

                8) Rule of 5 – You are only allowed to have 5 players when engaging in criminal activities such as heists and shootouts.  Only ONE vehicle is permitted at the location of the heist.  After engaging with police for a minimum of 90 seconds, you can then use a swap vehicle.

                <br>
                9) DO NOT sit in the train station to save your spot in city. Pick your character and start RP. You will be banned if found doing this.
                
                
                </h3>
                <hr>
                <b> <h2>Metagaming</h2></b>
                <h3>1) Do not use any out-of-character information to benefit your character.
                <br>
                <br>
                2) The use of a second character to gain and transfer any information is considered metagaming.
                Example:  You have one character who owns a business and gathers information but does not commit crime.  You have a second character who is the sister/brother of the first character who sells the information gathered by the first character.  This is considered LOW QUALITY RP and WILL NOT be tolerated.
                <br>
                <br>
                3) Using a third-party communication program like discord is strictly prohibited while IN GAME.  You must mute and deafen when you are in the city if you are in a gang/business/friend’s discord.  Please try to utilize in-game communication methods such as radios, phone calls, and text as much as possible.
                <br>
                <br>
                4) Using information gathered from watching a twitch stream of another player is strictly prohibited.  This is considered metagaming and will result in a permanent ban.  If a player is seen rule breaking on twitch, DO NOT report or open a ticket.  The staff team will handle the situation.

                <br>
                5) It is also strictly prohibited to watch another player's twitch stream while you are currently in the city.  Breaking this rule will result in a permanent ban with NO appeal.

                <b> <h2>Roleplay Guidelines</h2></b>
                <h3>1) Always engage in the roleplay that is taking place around you. Players who ignore other players are committing FailRP.
                <br>
                <br>
                2) Do not attempt to change how someone roleplays their character by forcing your roleplay styles on them.
                <br>
                <br>
                3) Do not kidnap, rob, assault, or harass EMS while on duty.  EMS is considered on duty while working at pillbox or responding to a scene in proper EMS uniform.  EMS is prohibited from wearing an EMS uniform while off duty.
                <br>
                <br>
                4) Do not kidnap, rob, or assault mechanics when they are on duty.  Mechanics are considered on duty when working inside the shop or operating/towing vehicles.  Mechanics are required to change uniforms when off duty.
                <br>
                <br>
                5) Do not use plain speech when downed unless EMS inquiries about your injuries. Instead, act as if your character has heavy wounds through your character's personality and mannerisms.
                <br>
                <br>
                6) If your character revives by any method other than a medical staff member or admin, you may not remember who or what killed you or any events that led up to your character's death.
                <br>
                <br>
                7) Unless you are revived by medical staff, you may not remember anything from the scene in which you were downed, and 1 hour leading up to the scene.  Returning to the scene prior to 30 minutes will be considered FailRP and may result in disciplinary actions.
                <br>
                <br>
                8) Do not seek revenge unless it is shared with you by another character through roleplay.
                <br>
                <br>
                9) Random robbing is not allowed. You must have a valid RP reason to rob another player. You cannot just rob someone on the street because you "feel like it". With this, you are not allowed to rob food, radio, phone, or any basic items off a player; only criminal items and money.

                <br>
                11) If you are downed and request EMS assistance you are REQUIRED to wait for EMS to arrive.  If you do not wait for EMS after requesting for help, it will be considered FailRP and will result in disciplinary actions.

                <br>
                14) Do not perform rape, mutilation, torture, dismemberment, cannibalism, or other highly graphic activities.  ERP is allowed but must be conducted in private.  DO NOT FORCE ERP ON ANYONE.  If you do, that will be considered FailRP and you will be permanently banned with no appeal.

                <h3>
                1) In instances of evident bugs/glitches or a violation of rules, administrators will attempt to reimburse players for losses. Individuals lacking sufficient evidence to substantiate claims of bugs, griefing, losses etc. may be denied compensation for losses.
                <br>
                <br>
                2) As a rule of thumb, we encourage players to avoid potentially risky behavior. Intentionally trying to perform a risky maneuver or trying to squeeze a trailer under an area with insufficient height will be considered user error and you will not be reimbursed.
                <br>
                <br>
                3) Administrators will not repair your vehicles, teleport you to places, give you items/money, etc. upon request. Players are expected to earn their belongings, and this applies to administrators as well. Administrative activity is logged and monitored by the developers.
